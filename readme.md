## PHP OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING (OOP)

HI, I am Oluwatimilehin, I am trying to understand the concept of `oop` in `PHP`

The few concept i have learnt so far are:

# Day 1:

- **classes** : class is a big object that contains a lot of diffrent information about something e.g variables and functions which are called propreties and method

- **properies**: they are variables inside a class.

- **Methods**: they are functions inside a class.

- **Objects** : they are a refrence to class.
 ```php
 
    <?php

        class NewClass{//this how to create a clas
           public $words = "hello world"; // is a property


        }
        $object = new NewClass; // this is an object which is the instance or refrence of a class

    ?>

 
 ```
